**Fig.1**: The idea of the proposed clustering method. (a) A synthetic dataset. (b)
An illustration for the potential surface. As the isopotential lines vary from red to blue, the potentials
in the corresponding areas become lower and lower. (c) The constructed In-Tree. The colors on
nodes denote the potentials corresponding to the cases in (b). (d) The constructed in-tree, in which
the inter-cluster edges are colored in red while the intra-cluster edges are in black. Note that the
graph structures in (c) and (d) are the same. (e) The plot in which the lengths of all the edges in the
In-Tree are arranged in decreasing order. (f) The result after removing the undesired edges (i.e., the
inter-cluster edges). The nodes in red are the root nodes of sub-graphs. (g) The result after the first
round of parallel searching of the root node for each non-root node. (h) The results after the last
round of parallel searching of the root nodes. All the non-root nodes are directly linked to their root
nodes. (i) The clustering result. The samples in the same colors are assigned to the same clusters.
